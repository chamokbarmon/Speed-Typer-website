           1. Local Storage Vs. Session Storage?
           <br><br>
          Ans : Session Storage: The sessionStorage object stores data only for a session. It means that the data stored in the sessionStorage will be deleted when the browser is closed.

           Local Storage: Unlike sessionStorage localStorage continues to store data after the browser is closed. It means that data stored in localStorage does not expire.

           2. Global Scope Vs. Block Scope? 
           <br><br>
            Scope: Visibility or Accessibility of a variable.
            
            Global Scope: If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it is said to be defined in the global scope. Once youâ€™ve declared a global variable, you can use that variable anywhere in your code, even in functions.
            
            Block Scope: When you declare a variable with const or let within a curly brace ({}), you can access this variable only within that curly brace.

           4.When do we get undefined in JavaScript?
            <br><br>
            1. When value is not defined.
            2. When a function does not return anything it return undefined.
            3. When you try to access a property of an object that does not exist.
